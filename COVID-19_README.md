### Problem Statement
This dashboard was created so as the compare the relationship between the ages of the patients and the likelihood of
a patient having an underlying illment which could lead to his/her death by covid-19 virus.

Steps followed
Step 1-Load the covid-19 dataset from Power BI tool
     2-I reconverted the data setting for the ages using "Column tools" and i went further to change "summarization" value 
       from sum to "Don't summarize" so that the ages value for the display on all visualizations would be displayed as 
       discrete values on the respective axes.
     3-The age column was grouped into 3 respective groups ie "AGE_Young","AGE_Mid" and AGE_Old" from the column tools window
     4-I went further to design the Text box for the dashboard
     5-created a line chart which provides the relationship for the ages of the patients with those who were referred to 
       ICU. From all indication we can see that pupils at the age of 30 were the highest which indicates that people of 
       young age "AGE_Mid" were largely affected.And people approaching the ages of 100 were the list which indicates that 
       only few elderly lived in the society.
     6-Created a pie chart displaying the relationship of patients who use tobacco who were asked to go home "1" and those
       who were asked to stay behind for further examination "2"
     7-Starked area chart was created showing the relationship of all age groups with the different diseases that affected
       individuals of all age category.
     8-Starked area chart was created that shows the correlation of ages to that of people having renal issues.
     9-Line chart was created to see the relationship age ranges that were mostly affected by hypertension and it waas found
       that both male and females of the age of 30 were mostly affected 
     10-A clustered column chart was created pneumonia and the age ranges affected
